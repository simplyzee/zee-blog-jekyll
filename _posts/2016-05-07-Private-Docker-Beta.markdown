Just recently, I formatted my Macbook and luckily enough the same day I'd received an e-mail to try out the new private Docker beta app.

All I can say is wow so far... It has simplified the process to get Docker running on my machine vastly. I can literally just download the app now and run it on the system in the background and then I can use my chosen terminal (iTerm 2) to query Docker commands.
Not only that but it has the cool Docker logo on the OS X toolbar!

Because of this I've now started creating Dockerfiles with my new projects I'm working on which use technology stacks such as React JS and Node JS together. If you're interested you can check them out here.

Even though the current version of Docker could improve my local dev environment, I'd have still had to install a load of resources to get it working. With this new BETA, I've been able to make the decision to cut Vagrant out and start focusing more on Docker.

For anyone else that has gained access to the private beta for docker - I'd love to hear your thoughts.
