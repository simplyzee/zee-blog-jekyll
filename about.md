Hi, I'm Zeieshan Ahmed **(known as Zee)**, 23 years old, Software Engineer.

By day, I work for a company writing software. In my spare time, I'll either be working on my ideas that I have, writing a blog post or the usual stuff that other people get up to.

I've been programming since I was a teenager. Started out with C++ writing the odd tool or program that would help me day to day... Moved onto C# working on 'security' software in my spare time which I did get a few hundred customers. Since then I've been building mobile apps for iOS (using Swift/Objective C) and tools/websites using Node JS or the Wordpress platform.

I also have big interests working with Continuous Delivery & Integration and the parts that build it to bring it together with Amazon AWS. These could include working with technology stacks such as GoCD, Docker, Terraform and Atlassian Bamboo.

If you have any questions, you can get in touch with me by either [tweeting me](http://www.twitter.com/zeieshanahmed) or sending me an email at [zee@simplyzee.co.uk](mailto:zee@simplyzee.co.uk)

If you're interested, you can check some of my repositories: [github](http://www.github.com/zee-ahmed)

**Ideas I've built soon to be added...**
